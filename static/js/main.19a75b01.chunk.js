Is it for me?",answer:"Financial Planning is for everyone. It helps you achieve your financial goals through a methodical approach. It ties together financial goals with cost-effectiveness to give you clarity on the best financial decisions for you. It may seem intimidating, but with a little help, financial planning can help you in the long run."},{id:2,question:"Who are SEBI registered Investment Advisors (RIA) ?",answer:"The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) follows a thorough procedure to grant a license to those you wish to carry out a financial advisory business in India. SEBI-registered Investment Advisors charge clients a direct fee in lieu of investment advice rather than selling any broker or AMC\u2019s product/service. Hence, they play the role of an unbiased investment advisor. A Fee-only advisor is one who, in all circumstances, is compensated solely by the client, with neither the advisor nor any related party receiving any compensation that is contingent on the purchase or sale of a financial product."},{id:3,question:"Why should I use a Fee-only registered Investment Advisor?",answer:"A Registered Investment Advisor must be licensed and registered with SEBI. A fee-only Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) means that neither the advisors nor the firm receives any commissions for the investment recommendations that they make to you. Fee-only RIAs like \u201cFinshield\u201d do not accept any compensation from any brokerage firms, mutual fund companies, or insurance companies. We are only paid by you, through a standard asset management fee. This approach ensures that we truly represent you with no conflicts of interest. Simply put, we understand how a commission can act as a hindrance to the advisory nature. Such a conflict of interest can not only cause you to lose money or bear losses but also dilutes the nature and quality of advice that you receive. This standard asset management fee structure also provides you with full transparency and no hidden surprises. Thus, you always know exactly how much you will pay for our financial services."},{id:4,question:"What is the difference between a distributor & an advisor?",answer:"A distributor generates income off commission form a third-party on selling a particular investment or insurance product. The most common examples of \u201cdistributors\u201d are banks, share brokers, and third-party financial institutions. On the other hand, an advisor is completely independent and the only compensation that he/she receives is in the form of fees for the professional services paid directly by their clients."},{id:5,question:"Does Finshield have an investment minimum?",answer:"We do not require a specified minimum value of assets to work with clients. Instead, we believe that a client\u2019s attitude towards investments and accumulation efforts is more important than their net worth or income. We take pride in working with clients of all size and shapes to help them grow their portfolio and achieve their individual financial goals."}]),l=function(e){var n=e.question,t=e.answer,s=Object(a.useState)(!1),o=Object(r.a)(s,2),c=o[0],l=o[1];return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,null,i.a.createElement("div",{className:"divMain"},i.a.createElement("p",{onClick:function(){return l(!c)}},c?"\u2796":"\u2795"),i.a.createElement("h3",null,n)),c&&i.a.createElement("p",{className:"answer"},t))},d=function(){var e=Object(a.useState)(c),n=Object(r.a)(e,2),t=n[0];n[1];return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,null,i.a.createElement("div",{className:"main"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"center_box"},i.a.createElement("h2",null,"AFQ's"),t.map(function(e){return i.a.createElement(l,Object.assign({key:e.id},e))}))))},u=t(5);o.a.render(i.a.createElement(u.a,null,i.a.createElement(d,null)),document.getElementById("root"))},3:function(e,n,t){},6:function(e,n,t){e.exports=t(15)}},[[6,2,1]]]);
